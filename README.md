# The Etymological Dictionary of Latin and the other Italic Languages in LiLa

In this repository we store data that:

* represent the etymology proposed in the EDLIL by de Vaan as LOD
* link them to the lemmas of the LiLa collection

This is an [example](https://lila-erc.eu/data/lexicalResources/BrillEDL/id/etymology/184)
of etymology, which can also be visualized using [LodLive](https://lila-erc.eu/lodlive/app_en.html?http://lila-erc.eu/data/lexicalResources/BrillEDL/id/etymology/184).

## How are the etymologies represented

We model the etymologies using the [`LemonEty`](https://github.com/anasfkhan81/lemonEty)
ontology. `LemonEty` is based on [Ontolex](https://www.w3.org/2016/05/ontolex/)
and is therefore easily integrated into LiLa.
